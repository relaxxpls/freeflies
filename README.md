# FreeFLies - Google Meet Recorder & Transcriber

A Streamlit application that automatically joins Google Meet sessions, records audio, and provides real-time transcription using OpenAI Whisper.

## Features

- üéôÔ∏è **Automated Meeting Join**: Uses Playwright to automatically join Google Meet sessions
- üéµ **Audio Recording**: Records system audio or microphone input during meetings
- üìù **Real-time Transcription**: Transcribes audio in real-time using OpenAI Whisper
- üåê **Web Interface**: Beautiful Streamlit dashboard for control and monitoring
- üíæ **Meeting History**: Saves recordings and transcriptions for future reference
- üîÑ **Streaming Display**: Shows transcription as it happens
- üéØ **Multi-language Support**: Supports 90+ languages through Whisper

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Poetry (for dependency management)
- System audio recording capabilities

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd freeflies
   ```

2. **Install dependencies using Poetry**:

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

3. **Install Playwright browsers**:

   ```bash
   poetry run playwright install
   ```

4. **Activate the virtual environment**:

   ```bash
   poetry shell
   ```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

1. **Start the Streamlit application**:

   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501`

3. **Enter Google Meet URL** in the sidebar

4. **Click "Start Recording"** to begin the process

5. **Monitor real-time transcription** in the main panel

6. **Stop recording** when finished

### Configuration

You can configure the application using environment variables:

```bash
# Audio settings
export AUDIO_SAMPLE_RATE=44100
export AUDIO_CHANNELS=2
export AUDIO_CHUNK_DURATION=2.0

# Whisper settings
export WHISPER_MODEL_SIZE=base  # tiny, base, small, medium, large
export WHISPER_LANGUAGE=en
export WHISPER_DEVICE=auto      # auto, cpu, cuda, mps

# Playwright settings
export PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=false
export PLAYWRIGHT_TIMEOUT=30000

# Testing (use dummy implementations)
export USE_DUMMY_IMPLEMENTATIONS=true
```

### Model Sizes

Choose the appropriate Whisper model size based on your needs:

- **tiny**: Fastest, least accurate (~39 MB)
- **base**: Good balance (~74 MB) - **Default**
- **small**: Better accuracy (~244 MB)
- **medium**: High accuracy (~769 MB)
- **large**: Best accuracy (~1550 MB)

## How It Works

1. **Meeting Join**: The `MeetBot` class uses Playwright to automate browser interactions and join Google Meet sessions
2. **Audio Recording**: The `AudioRecorder` class captures system audio or microphone input in real-time
3. **Transcription**: The `Transcriber` class processes audio chunks using OpenAI Whisper and returns text
4. **Streaming**: The Streamlit app displays transcription results in real-time as they're generated

## Alternatives to Playwright

While Playwright is used in this implementation, here are other approaches you might consider:

### 1. **Browser Extensions**

- More reliable access to browser audio
- Better integration with Google Meet
- Requires extension development and installation

### 2. **WebRTC Direct Connection**

- Direct access to meeting audio streams
- More stable than browser automation
- Requires Google Meet API access (limited availability)

### 3. **System Audio Capture**

- Use virtual audio cables (e.g., VoiceMeeter on Windows, BlackHole on macOS)
- Capture system audio directly
- More reliable but requires additional setup

### 4. **Google Meet API**

- Official API access (when available)
- Most reliable approach
- Currently limited availability

### 5. **Selenium**

- Similar to Playwright but older
- More community support
- Generally slower than Playwright

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Audio Recording Failed**
   - Check microphone permissions
   - Ensure audio device is available
   - Try different audio devices in settings

2. **Meet Join Failed**
   - Verify the Google Meet URL is correct
   - Check if authentication is required
   - Ensure Playwright browsers are installed

3. **Transcription Not Working**
   - Verify Whisper model is loaded
   - Check GPU/CPU availability
   - Try a smaller model size

4. **Permission Errors**
   - Grant microphone access to the browser
   - Allow system audio recording permissions

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```bash
export DEBUG=true
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

### Testing Mode

Use dummy implementations for testing:

```bash
export USE_DUMMY_IMPLEMENTATIONS=true
```

## Privacy & Ethics

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Always ensure you have proper permissions before recording any meeting. Be transparent about recording and transcription activities. Follow your organization's policies and local laws regarding meeting recordings.
